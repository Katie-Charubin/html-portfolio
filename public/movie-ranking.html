<h1>The Best Shows According to Katie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favorite shows of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>How I Met Your Mother</h3>
This is my favorite sitcom. I can always re-watch it when I need to feel better.
<h3>Gossip Girl</h3>
This is the best teen drama, with my all time favorite TV couple (Chuck and Blair).
<h3>Grey's Anatomy</h3>
The new seasons are bad, but the first 9 are amazing!
